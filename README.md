Microsoft.Recognizers.Text provides robust recognition and resolution of entities like numbers, units, and date/time; expressed in multiple languages. Full support for Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Partial support for German and Japanese. More on the way.

# Utilizing the Project

Microsoft.Recognizers.Text powers pre-built entities in both [**LUIS: Language Understanding Intelligent Service**](https://www.luis.ai/home) and [**Microsoft Bot Framework**](https://dev.botframework.com/); and is also available as standalone packages (for the base classes and the different entity recognizers).

The Microsoft.Recognizers.Text packages currently target three platforms:
* [C# version](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text/tree/master/.NET) - **NuGet packages** available at: https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Recognizers.Text
* [JavaScript version](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text/tree/master/JavaScript/packages/recognizers-text-suite) - **NPM packages** available at: https://www.npmjs.com/~recognizers.text
* [Python version](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text/tree/master/Python) (in progress)

Contributions are greatly welcome! Both for fixes and extensions in the currently supported languages and for expansion to new ones.
Especially for Japanese, Italian, Korean, and Dutch.
